# Murach's Android Code
Code from *Murach's Android Programming, 2nd Ed.*, by Joel Murach, Murach Books, 2015

This code was downloaded from the publisher's web site, [Murach Books](https://www.murach.com/shop/murach-s-android-programming-2nd-edition-detail), then updated to compile and run with the current development tools as of October--November 2019.

These are the apps that have been updated so far:
- Book Apps
  - Ch. 3 through 10, and ch. 13
- Exercise Starts
  - Ch. 3 through 10, and ch. 13
- Exercise Solutions
  - Ch. 2 through 10, and ch. 13
  

Note: I fixed a bug in the ch. 10 newsreader caused by the XML no longer containing a publication date for items, only for the feed.
